# ContactManagementSystem

/**
 *
 * This program allows users to manage a digital address book by performing various operations such as adding, displaying,
 * deleting, searching, modifying, and clearing contacts. It utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to
 * provide a modular and organized approach to contact  management.
 *
 * Classes:
 *   1. Contact - Represents an individual contact with attributes such as name, gender, age, phone number, and address.
 *   2. AddressBook - Manages a collection of contacts and provides operations to add, display, delete, search, modify,
 *                    and clear contacts.
 *
 * Main Functionality:
 *   1. Adding a Contact - Allows users to add a new contact to the address book by providing the necessary details.
 *   2. Displaying Contacts - Shows all the contacts present in the address book.
 *   3. Deleting a Contact - Enables users to delete a contact by specifying the name of the contact to be deleted.
 *   4. Searching for a Contact - Searches for a contact by name and displays their details if found.
 *   5. Modifying a Contact - Modifies the details of a contact by providing the new values for the attributes.
 *   6. Clearing Contacts - Removes all contacts from the address book.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   1. Compile and run the program.
 *   2. Choose an option from the displayed menu by entering the corresponding number.
 *   3. Follow the prompts and provide the required inputs to perform the desired operation.
 *   4. Repeat the process as needed until the program is exited.
 *
 * OOP Concepts Used:
 *   1. Classes and Objects - The program defines classes (Contact and AddressBook) to encapsulate the data and behavior
 *                           related to contacts and address books. Objects of these classes are created to manage contacts
 *                           and perform operations.
 *   2. Encapsulation - The classes encapsulate data members (attributes) and member functions (methods) to provide
 *                      abstraction and controlled access to the contact details and address book operations.
 *   3. Modularity - The program is structured into classes and member functions, promoting modularity and code
 *                   organization. Each class is responsible for a specific set of tasks.
